A test application (in progress) to get data from Arduino device via com port 

that is sending packets given from the CAN network from a car. 

Now it is simple visualizing the data by creating the controls on form dynamically and tracing the data by CAN Id. 

Arduino sketch is also provided. 

The app support Aduino with 2 MCP 2515 (8mhz) connected to SPI with using different CS lines and different CAN speeds

(in Mazda 6 1st gen there are 500Kbps and 125Kbps buses).

It is not completely done.
