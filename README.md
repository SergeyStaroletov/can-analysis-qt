# can-analysis-qt

A test application (in progress) to get data from Arduino device via com port 

It gets packets from the CAN network from a car. 

Now it is simple visualizing the data by creating the controls on form dynamically and tracing the data by CAN Id. 

Arduino sketch is also provided. Connection photo and a test tool are also present.
 
The app supports Aduino Nano with 2 MCP 2515 (8mhz) connected to SPI with using different CS lines and different CAN speeds

(in Mazda 6 1st gen there are 500Kbps and 125Kbps buses).

It is not completely done.
